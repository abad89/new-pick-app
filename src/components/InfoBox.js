        <p>This app demonstrates my idea for a redesign of Amazon's delivery station picking app. 
          The director leads you to scan each bag in order, and to scan the cart in between in bag. The bag-colored border fills in after the bag has been picked. 
          After all the bags have been picked, the picker is directed to scan the staging location. Refresh for a new picklist.</p>
